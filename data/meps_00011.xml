  <txt><![CDATA[RECTYPE is an IPUMS MEPS-constructed variable that allows users to discriminate between the different record types in the data. For non-vacant households, each household record is followed by one or more person records. Data at the household level pertain to each person in the household.

Round level records indicate information that is collected during one or more of the five interview rounds that each respondent participates in.

Event, medication-round, and medication-round fill records indicate information that is collected for a specific medical event. Condition level records indicate information that is collected about a specific medical condition. Please see our  overview of the event, medical conditions, and prescribed medicines variables, how those variables are offered through IPUMS MEPS, and general considerations to keep in mind when conducting analyses using these variables.

Event-medication-round link records indicate information that can be used to link event records to medication-round and medication-round fill records. Condition-event link records indicate information that can be used to link condition records to event, medication-round, and medication-round fill records.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, DUID reports the identifier assigned by MEPS to the person's Dwelling Unit (DU), sampled for MEPS data collection. DUID is a random ID number assigned after the DU was sampled for MEPS and does not change once assigned. The MEPS sample is a subset of the households that participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). 

DU definitions are generally consistent with NHIS definitions of households. For example, the 2018 NHIS Survey Description document describes households as "occupied housing units" (p. 10) that exclude "long-term care institutions (for example, nursing homes for the elderly, hospitals for the chronically ill or physically or intellectually disabled, and wards for abused or neglected children), correctional facilities (for example, prisons or jails, juvenile detention centers, and halfway houses)." (p. 8). Additionally, "unless one other family member is a civilian eligible for the survey (for example, a child whose parents are both active-duty military)" (p. 8), housing units occupied by active-duty Armed Forces personnel are also excluded from the survey. 

From 1996-2017, DUID is unique within panel, but must be combined with PANEL to be unique across panels. Starting in 2018, DUID begins with the 2-digit variable PANEL, making DUID unique across panels. DUID can be combined with PID to uniquely identify each person within the Dwelling Unit. Please see the user note for more information on the relationship between Dwelling Units, families, Reporting Units, and persons.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, PID is a within-Dwelling Unit (DU) person identifier assigned in sampling or by the computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) instrument. PID must be combined with DUID and PANEL to uniquely identify persons across all MEPS data. IPUMS MEPS offers the constructed variable MEPSID, created by concatenating the values of DUID, PID, and PANEL.

  <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, MEPSID is a variable that uniquely identifies respondents across MEPS panels. It is created by combining PANEL, DUID, and PID. IPUMS MEPS staff create MEPSID for the 1996-2017 samples to provide a single, universal linking key for MEPS persons. Beginning in 2018, AHRQ modified the identifiers DUID and DUPERSID (which combines DUID with PID) on the original MEPS data files to append information about PANEL to the first two columns. This update makes DUPERSID identical to MEPSID in the IPUMS MEPS extract system for 2018-forward.

In earlier versions of IPUMS MEPS, IPUMS MEPS staff created a slightly different version of MEPSID, equivalent to combining DUID, PID, and PANEL. This version has been renamed to MEPSID2 and is only available for 1996-2017.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, PANEL reports the number of the panel of which the person was a member. MEPS began in 1996 with Panel number 1 and the panel number for persons entering the MEPS in each subsequent year increases by 1, so that 1997 had Panels 1 (the panel that entered in 1996, in their second year in 1997) and 2 (the panel newly entering MEPS in 1997), 1998 had Panels 2 and 3, 1999 had Panels 3 and 4, and so on. PANEL can be combined with DUID and PID to uniquely identify individuals across panels. IPUMS MEPS offers the constructed variable MEPSID that is equal to the concatenated values of DUID, PID, and PANEL.

For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population. 

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly when analyzing variables from the Self-Administered Questionnaire or the Diabetes Care Survey, or when conducting longitudinal analyses with the MEPS data. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the Self-Administered Questionnaire from 2000 forward should use SAQWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT.

In 2000, SAQWEIGHT also includes weighting information for children under the age of 18 whose parent or guardian completed the Parent Administered Questionnaire (PAQ). For 2000 only, the sum of SAQWEIGHT is equal to the full civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population. SAQWEIGHT does differ from PERWEIGHT in 2000 because the poststratification age group of 15-19 was partitioned into two groups, 15-17 and 18-19, for SAQWEIGHT to account for the target populations of the SAQ and PAQ.

Collection of information on SEX in MEPS&nbsp;Data on the sex of each reporting unit (RU) member was determined during the NHIS interview, and was then verified, and, if necessary, corrected during each MEPS interview.

If the respondent was a new RU member or their sex was not ascertained in the NHIS interview, MEPS initially used the first name of the respondent to assign their sex. If the first name gave no clear indication of sex, the reported family relationships were used to assign sex. If the sex of the respondent was still unclear, sex was randomly assigned. 

The NHIS method of ascertaining the sex of the respondent, which primarily informs the MEPS version of SEX, is similar to the MEPS method. First, sex of the respondent was inferred from the individual's first name or family relationships. If the sex of the respondent was unclear, the interviewer was instructed to explicitly ask the person's sex. Beginning in 1998, interviewers were told to "enter your best guess" when the respondent either did not know or refused to answer the direct question that was asked about the person's sex.]]></txt>

IPUMS MEPS reports the universe for each variable based on a thorough review of the original MEPS documentation. Investigating the data may reveal cases that do not meet the stated universe. Users are encouraged to validate universes for their analyses.

In 2002, 2003, and 2007-2013, USBORN was asked of all persons eligible for the Access to Care section (ACCESSELIG) who were not deceased or institutionalized. The Access to Care section gathers information on usual source of care for all family members, characteristics of usual source of care health providers, and barriers family members have faced in obtaining needed healthcare. From 2002-2013, the Access to Care section also collected information about language and nativity status. Beginning in 2013, USBORN was moved to the Demographic section. Persons in Panel 17 were not asked USBORN in 2013. Instead, their 2012 response to the question from the Access to Care section was simply copied to the 2013 file and persons in Panel 18 were asked USBORN in the Demographic section.]]></txt>

  <labl>Constructed total CPS family income</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[Available in all survey years, FTOTINCCPS is an IPUMS MEPS-constructed variable that represents the sum of total personal income (INCTOT) (excluding tax refunds and capital gains) across all members of the CPS-defined family. 

CPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, adoption and residing together. Unlike the MEPS-defined family, CPS family does not include unmarried partners or foster children.

FTOTINCCPS was constructed by summing the public (edited and top-coded) versions of total individual income over CPS family members, as defined by CPSFAMID, to yield CPS family-level total income. Person-level total income amounts comprised annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, commissions; business and farm games and losses; unemployment and workers' compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, IRA withdrawals, social security, and veterans payments; supplemental security income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and related programs; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of "other" income. Person-level, and thus family-level, income excluded tax refunds and capital gains. 

Beginning in 2007, the variable FTOTVAL was constructed from the person-level total income variable (INCTOT). Additionally, the IPUMS MEPS-constructed variable FTOTINCMEPS offers total family income for MEPS-defined families (includes foster children and unmarried partners).

  <txt><![CDATA[POVCAT is a categorical variable reporting family income as a percentage of the poverty line.

POVCAT uses family income and CPS family size. CPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. Unlike the MEPS defined family, CPS family does not include unmarried partners or foster children.

Family income is constructed using person-level total income, comprised of: annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, commissions;  business and farm gains and losses; unemployment and workman's compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, IRA withdrawals, social security, and veterans payments; supplemental security income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and Aid to Dependent Children; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of "other" income. Family income excluded tax refunds and capital gains.  

Person-level income totals were then summed over family members as defined by CPSFAMID to yield the family-level total.  POVCAT is constructed by dividing family income by the applicable poverty line (based on family size and composition), with the resulting percentages grouped into the following 5 categories: 
1. Negative or poor (LT 100% poverty line) 
2. Near poor (100-124% poverty line) 
3. Low income (125-199% poverty line 
4. Middle income (200-399% poverty line) 
5. High income (GE 400% poverty line)

Persons missing CPSFAMID were treated as one-person families in constructing POVCAT.

Logical editing or weighted, sequential hot-deck imputation were used to impute income amounts for missing values (both for non-response and for persons in the full-year file who were not in the round where income questions were asked). Round-level data on employment status, hours worked, and wages were used to supplement earnings data collected in the Income Section. 

A continuous variable POVLEV for the ratio of total family income to federal poverty line is also available beginning in 2007. An IPUMS MEPS constructed variable (POVCATCPS) offers CPS family income to poverty level ratio data in more detailed categories, for all survey years. POVLEV and POVCPSCAT calculate family income to poverty level ratios for the CPS family (excludes foster children and unmarried partners). Additionally, an IPUMS MEPS constructed variable (POVCATMEPS) is available for all survey years, and contains more detailed poverty line ratio categories for MEPS families (includes foster children and unmarried partners). POVCATCPS and POVCATMEPS are constructed from the public (edited and top-coded) versions of total individual income (summed across MEPS family), and therefore may not match POVCAT.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[POVLEV is a continuous measure of the ratio of total family income (excluding capital gains and tax refunds) to the federal poverty line. AHRQ staff constructed POVLEV primarily from data collected in the Income section of the MEPS questionnaire, by dividing CPS family income by the applicable poverty line (based on family size and composition).

CPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. Unlike the MEPS-defined family, the CPS family definition does not include unmarried partners or foster children.

Family income was constructed by first creating person-level total income, comprising annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, and commissions (INCWAGE); business and farm gains and losses (INCBUS); unemployment (INCUNEMP) and workers' compensation (INCWKCOM); interest (INCINT) and dividends (INCDIVID); alimony (INCALIM), child support (INCCHLD), and other private cash transfers (INCCASH); private pensions (INCRETIR), IRA withdrawals (INCIRA), social security (INCSS), and veterans payments (INCVET); supplemental security income (INCSSI) and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and Aid to Dependent Children (INCWELFR); gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties (INCPROP and INCTRST); and a small amount of "other" income (INCOTH). Family income excluded tax refunds and capital gains.  

Person-level income totals were then summed over family members as defined by CPSFAMID to yield the family-level total. Persons missing CPSFAMID were treated as one-person families in constructing POVLEV.

To construct POVCATCPS, total individual income amounts were first summed across members of the CPS family (defined by CPSFAMID) to yield a CPS family income total.  The total CPS family income amount was then divided by the applicable poverty line (based on family size and composition), with the resulting percentages grouped into fourteen categories.

Persons missing CPSFAMID were treated as one-person families in constructing POVCATCPS.

  <txt><![CDATA[HIMACHIP indicates whether the person currently had health insurance coverage through public assistance, Medicaid, or a State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). This variable was constructed by AHRQ staff based on the values of the corresponding 12 month-by-month Medicaid health insurance coverage variables (MAJA-MADE).

Definitions&nbsp;Family respondents were asked about public assistance, Medicaid, or SCHIP coverage during the Health Insurance portion of the questionnaire. Respondents were asked "Let's talk (again) about all the health insurance coverage the family may have to help pay for the costs of medical care (since {START DATE}/between {START DATE} and {END DATE}}." Respondents were prompted to retrieve any insurance cards or identifying information to help answer questions about health insurance coverage. 

Respondents were asked "{Medicaid/{STATE NAME FOR MEDICAID}} or {STATE CHIP NAME} are state programs that pay for health care for persons in need. People covered by {Medicaid/{STATE NAME FOR MEDICAID}} or {STATE CHIP NAME} may have a (piece of paper/card) that looks something like this.

At any time {since {START DATE}/between {START DATE} and {END DATE}}, has anyone in the family been covered by {Medicaid/{STATE NAME FOR MEDICAID}} or {STATE CHIP NAME}?" If respondents needed more explanation of Medicaid or SCHIP, they were told:

"Medicaid is a federally-assisted, state-administered program that offers health benefits to low income persons on public assistance. The program also may cover the aged, the blind, and the disabled who are in financial need. Medicaid may be known by different names in different states.

The Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) is a program which gives each state permission to offer health insurance for children, up to age 19, who are not already insured and for uninsured families with limited income and resources who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. SCHIP is a state administered program and may be known by different names in different states."]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[For all persons given the Diabetes Care Survey (DCS) and have been told they have diabetes (DIABETICEV), DCSDIABDX indicates whether the respondent has ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they have diabetes or sugar diabetes.

DCSDIABDX is one of a set of variables comprising the DCS, a supplemental, self-administered pencil-and-paper survey about how respondents treat their diabetes. For related variables and more information, please see DIACONF. 

Notes about the Universe&nbsp;According to the AHRQ documentation, all persons aged 18 and older who are marked by the family respondent as "yes" to DIABETICEV earlier in the MEPS CAPI instrument receive a paper copy of the DCS questionnaire to complete. The first question on the DCS questionnaire repeats the content of DIABETICEV, asking whether a doctor or other health care professional has ever told them that they have diabetes or sugar diabetes. Theoretically, only people with a "yes" response on DIABETICEV should be in universe for DCSDIABDX, and all people who answer "no" to DIABETICEV should be out of universe for DCSDIABDX (because receipt of the DCS is conditional on answering "yes" to DIABETICEV). However, beginning in 2008, there are approximately 20-70 individuals each year who answer "no" to DIABETICEV, but receive the DCS and answer "yes" to DCSDIABDX. Given the stated path to receiving a DCS according to MEPS documentation, it is not clear how these individuals received a DCS and why their answers to DIABETICEV and DCSDIABDX are conflicting. For more information about how a participant should receive the DCS, please see the Diabetes Care Survey user note.
 
The discrepancies between answers to DIABETICEV and DCSDIABDX begin to appear with Panel 12, the same panel in which the DIABETICEV question was moved from the Quality (Priority Conditions) Supplement Section (PC) to the Priority Conditions Enumeration (PE) Section. 

Additionally, DCSDIABDX only takes on values of "yes" or "out of universe." For those who answered "yes" to DIABETICEV and are out of universe for DCSDIABDX, it is not clear if they refused to answer the question or if they erroneously reported having diabetes in DIABETICEV, subsequently received the DCS, and correctly answered "no" to DCSDIABDX.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[For all medication-round records, DUIDM reports the identifier assigned by MEPS to the person's Dwelling Unit (DU), sampled for MEPS data collection. DUIDM is a random ID number assigned after the DU was sampled for MEPS and does not change once assigned. The MEPS sample is a subset of households that participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). 

DU definitions are generally consistent with NHIS definitions of households. For example, the 2018 NHIS Survey Description document describes households as "occupied housing units" (p. 10) that exclude "long-term care institutions (for example, nursing homes for the elderly, hospitals for the chronically ill or physically or intellectually disabled, and wards for abused or neglected children), correctional facilities (for example, prisons or jails, juvenile detention centers, and halfway houses)." (p. 8). Additionally, "unless one other family member is a civilian eligible for the survey (for example, a child whose parents are both active-duty military)" (p. 8), housing units occupied by active-duty Armed Forces personnel are also excluded from the survey.

From 1996-2017, DUIDM is unique within panel, but must be combined with PANELM to be unique across panels. Starting in 2018, DUIDM begins with the 2-digit variable PANELM, making DUIDM unique across panels. DUIDM can be combined with PIDM to uniquely identify each person within the Dwelling Unit.

PANELM can be combined with DUIDM and PIDM to uniquely identify individuals across panels on medication-round records. IPUMS MEPS offers the constructed variable MEPSIDM that is equal to the concatenated values of PANELM, DUIDM, and PIDM. Beginning in 2018, DUIDM begins with PANELM and so concatenating PANELM with DUIDM and PIDM is no longer necessary.

  <txt><![CDATA[For all medication-round records, LINKIDM is an AHRQ-generated identifier that uniquely identifies medication-round records. LINKIDM is created by combining DUPERSIDM with a numeric value that is the same for each fill of a medication within a given round. LINKIDM differs for the same medication across rounds (see MEPSDRUGID for a unique drug identifier across rounds). From 1996-2017, LINKIDM uniquely identifies medication-round records within a panel. To uniquely identify records across all MEPS panels, please see MEPSLINKIDM. Beginning in 2018, LINKIDM uniquely identifies medication-round records across panels due to changes in the construction of DUPERSIDM to add PANELM to the first two digits of the DUPERSIDM identifier and the addition of a 2-digit event type number.

Event-Medication-Round Record Linking
The event, medication-round, and medication-round fill records can be joined together by using the event-medication-round link records. LINKIDM is on the medication-round record and is the same as LINKIDK on the event-medication-round link record and LINKIDF on the medication-round fill record. The event-medication-round link records (K rectype) and medication-round fill records (F rectype) can be linked to the medication-round records (M rectype) using LINKIDK, LINKIDF, and LINKIDM, respectively. However, due to changes in how LINKIDM is constructed over time, IPUMS MEPS recommends using MEPSLINKIDK, MEPSLINKIDM, and MEPSLINKIDF to join the event-medication-round link, medication-round, and medication-round fill records.

See our user note for more details on how to join the different record types and an overview of the event, medical conditions, and prescribed medicines variables, how those variables are offered through IPUMS MEPS, and general considerations to keep in mind when conducting analyses using these variables.]]></txt>

  <labl>Dwelling unit ID, medication-round fill record</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[For all medication-round fills, DUIDF reports the identifier assigned by MEPS to the person's Dwelling Unit (DU), sampled for MEPS data collection. DUIDF is a random ID number assigned after the DU was sampled for MEPS and does not change once assigned. The MEPS sample  is a subset of households that participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). 

DU definitions are generally consistent with NHIS definitions of households. For example, the 2018 NHIS Survey Description document describes households as "occupied housing units" (p. 10) that exclude "long-term care institutions (for example, nursing homes for the elderly, hospitals for the chronically ill or physically or intellectually disabled, and wards for abused or neglected children), correctional facilities (for example, prisons or jails, juvenile detention centers, and halfway houses)." (p. 8). Additionally, "unless one other family member is a civilian eligible for the survey (for example, a child whose parents are both active-duty military)" (p. 8), housing units occupied by active-duty Armed Forces personnel are also excluded from the survey.

From 1996-2017, DUIDF is unique within panel, but must be combined with PANELF to be unique across panels. Starting in 2018, DUIDF begins with the 2-digit variable PANELF, making DUIDF unique across panels. DUIDF can be combined with PIDF to uniquely identify each person within the Dwelling Unit.

PANELF can be combined with DUIDF and PIDF to uniquely identify individuals across panels on the medication-round fill records. IPUMS MEPS offers the constructed variable MEPSIDF that is equal to the concatenated values of PANELF, DUIDF, and PIDF. Beginning in 2018, DUIDF begins with PANELF and so concatenating PANELF with DUIDF and PIDF is no longer necessary.

  <txt><![CDATA[For all medication-round fills, RXRECID is an AHRQ-generated identifier that uniquely identifies medication-round fill records.

  <txt><![CDATA[For all medication-round fills, LINKIDF is an AHRQ-generated identifier that uniquely identifies medication-round records. LINKIDF is created by combining DUPERSIDF with a numeric value that is the same for each fill of a medication within a given round. LINKIDF differs for the same medication across rounds (see MEPSDRUGID for a unique drug identifier across rounds). From 1996-2017, LINKIDF uniquely identifies medication-round records within a panel. To uniquely identify records across all MEPS panels, please see MEPSLINKIDF. Beginning in 2018, LINKIDF uniquely identifies medication-round records across panels due to changes in the construction of DUPERSIDF to add PANELF to the first two digits of the DUPERSIDF identifier and the addition of a 2-digit event type number.  

Event-Medication-Round Record Linking
The event, medication-round, and medication-round fill records can be joined together by using the event-medication-round link records. LINKIDF is on the medication-round fill record and is the same as LINKIDM on the medication-round record and LINKIDK on the event-medication-round link record. The event-medication-round link records (K rectype) and medication-round fill records (F rectype) can be linked to the medication-round records (M rectype) using LINKIDK, LINKIDF, and LINKIDM, respectively. However, due to changes in how LINKIDF is constructed over time, IPUMS MEPS recommends using MEPSLINKIDK, MEPSLINKIDM, and MEPSLINKIDF to join the event-medication-round link, medication-round, and medication-round fill records.

See also RXNDC and RXDRGNAM for additional information about prescribed medication-round fill attributes. 

A drug can pose a confidentiality risk for several reasons. Examples include orphan drugs, drugs that are estimated to be used by fewer than 200,000 people, or drug names that provide identifying information about the pharmacy or respondent. An orphan drug is a drug that treats a rare disease or condition but has been discontinued because there is little or no economic incentive to continue development or production. See Rare Diseases at the FDA for more information about how these drugs are designated and the effort to financially support their development and production under the Orphan Drug Act. See the codes tab for more detailed information about how cases that pose a confidentiality risk are handled in the data.

IPUMS MEPS reports the universe for each variable based on a thorough review of the original MEPS documentation. Investigating the data may reveal cases that do not meet the stated universe. Users are encouraged to validate universes for their analyses.

  <codInstr><![CDATA[CodesRXNAME is a 50-character string variable.

In 1996-2006 samples, in the case that a prescription drug name was determined to be a confidentiality risk, RXNAME is assigned a value of 0: "Not in Universe." Users should note that in the original documentation, this value was -9: "Not Ascertained." 

In 2015-onward samples, in the case that a prescription drug name was determined to be an orphan drug or a drug estimated to be used by fewer than 200,000 people, the most detailed Multum Lexicon therapeutic classification value available (see MULTC1) replaced RXNAME (pharmacy-reported medication name). The most detailed classification value available means that if a medication fill has a sub-sub-class value assigned, such as "SSRI antidepressants," this is the value used for RXNAME in the case that the drug name was determined to be a confidentiality risk. If a medication fill has a sub-class value, such as "antidepressants," but no sub-sub-class value is assigned, then the sub-class value is the value used for RXNAME. If a medication fill has a class value, such as "psychotherapeutic agents," but no sub-class or sub-sub-class value is assigned, then the class value is the value used for RXNAME.

In 2015-onward samples, in the case that a prescription drug name was determined to be a confidentiality risk for reasons other than it being an orphan drug or a drug used by fewer than 200,000 people, RXNAME is assigned a value of 0: "Not in Universe." Users should note that in the original documentation for 2018-onward samples, this value was -15: "Cannot be Computed." 

In 2007, 2009, and 2010 samples, in the case that a prescription drug name was determined to be a confidentiality risk, the original documentation suggests that the most detailed Multum Lexicon therapeutic classification value available replaced RXNAME, however, the data indicate that RXNAME is assigned a value of 0: "Not in Universe."

In 2008, 2011, and 2012 samples, in the case that a prescription drug name was determined to be a confidentiality risk, the original documentation suggests that the most detailed Multum Lexicon therapeutic classification value available replaced RXNAME, however, neither the Multum Lexicon therapeutic classification values nor values of 0: "Not in Universe" are present in the data for RXNAME. 

In the 2013 sample, in the case that a prescription drug name was determined to be a confidentiality risk, the original documentation suggests that the most detailed Multum Lexicon therapeutic classification value available replaced RXNAME, and the data indicates that this is the case. Additionally, the data contains RXNAME values of 0: "Not in Universe" that are not identified in the original documentation. 

In the 2014 sample, in the case that a prescription drug name was determined to be a confidentiality risk, RXNAME is assigned a value of 0: "Not in Universe," which is in line with both the original documentation and the data. However, some RXNAME values are assigned the most detailed Multum Lexicon therapeutic classification value, which is not identified in the original documentation.]]></codInstr>

  <txt><![CDATA[For all medication-round fills, except for drugs determined to be a confidentiality risk (see below), RXNDC reports the National Drug Code (NDC) of the prescribed medicine. The NDC is provided during the pharmacy component of the MEPS survey. In cases where the NDC provided by the pharmacy is not valid, a secondary data source is used to impute a valid value for that prescribed medicine. See the comparability tab for more information about how these cases are handled over time. See also RXNAME and RXDRGNAM for additional information about prescribed medication-round fill attributes. 

In most cases, each prescribed medicine is associated with one RXNDC value, however, each fill of a prescribed medicine can have a unique RXNDC value in cases where the medication's form, strength, manufacturer, or package size differ across fills. Thus, a prescribed medicine may have only been reported once in the household component but may be represented by multiple medication-round fills with unique RXNDC values in the data.

For 1996-2008 samples, RXNDC was used to link drugs across rounds. Beginning in 2009, DRUGID was introduced as the "prescribed medicine drug-level ID" and replaced RXNDC as the variable used to link drugs over time. See DRUGID for more information about linking drugs across MEPS rounds and see MEPSDRUGID for more information about linking drugs across MEPS panels.

A drug can pose a confidentiality risk for several reasons. Examples include orphan drugs, drugs that are estimated to be used by fewer than 200,000 people, or drug names that provide identifying information about the pharmacy or respondent. An orphan drug is a drug that treats a rare disease or condition but has been discontinued because there is little or no economic incentive to continue development or production.

  <txt><![CDATA[For all medication-round fills, except diabetic equipment and supplies (see RXNAME) and drugs determined to be a confidentiality risk, RXDRGNAM reports the generic name most commonly used by prescribing physicians for the medication. The drug classification system used to assign RXDRGNAM has remained consistent over time, making it well-suited for trend analyses or pooling years or panels together. RXDRGNAM is assigned using the Multum Lexicon database (for more information about the Multum Lexicon database, see the following section). See also RXNAME and RXNDC for additional information about prescribed medication-round fill attributes. 

A drug can pose a confidentiality risk for several reasons. Examples include orphan drugs, drugs that are estimated to be used by fewer than 200,00 people, or drug names that provide identifying information about the pharmacy or respondent. An orphan drug is a drug that treats a rare disease or condition but has been discontinued because there is little or no economic incentive to continue development or production. See Rare Diseases at the FDA for more information about how these drugs are designated and the effort to financially support their development and production under the Orphan Drug Act. See the codes tab for more detailed information about how these cases are handled in the data. 

RXDRGNAM is on the prescribed medication-round fill record (or "medication-round fill record," see RECTYPE for more details on the different record types in IPUMS MEPS). Variables offered on the medication-round fill record through IPUMS MEPS are derived from the prescribed medicines file provided by AHRQ.

Multum Lexicon Variables

Cerner Multum, Inc. develops the Multum Lexicon database that MEPS uses to classify drugs reported by respondents in the MEPS-HC. Each drug is assigned a Multum drug name (RXDRGNAM), a pregnancy category (PREGCAT), and to one or more therapeutic class, sub-class, and sub-sub-class designations (see MULTC1 for more information about the Multum Lexicon variables). 

Users of the Multum Lexicon variables should cite Multum Lexicon, AHRQ, and IPUMS MEPS as the data sources.]]></txt>
  <codInstr><![CDATA[CodesRXDRGNAM is a 60-character string variable. 

In 2014-onward samples, in the case that a prescription drug name was determined to be a confidentiality risk, the most detailed Multum Lexicon therapeutic classification value available (see MULTC1) replaced RXDRGNAM (Multum drug name). The most detailed classification value available means that if a medication fill has a sub-sub-class value assigned, such as “SSRI antidepressants,” this is the value used for RXDRGNAM in the case that the drug name was determined to be a confidentiality risk. If a medication fill has a sub-class value, such as “antidepressants,” but no sub-sub-class value assigned, then the sub-class value is the value used for RXDRGNAM. If a medication fill has a class value, such as “psychotherapeutic agents,” but no sub-class or sub-sub-class value assigned, then the class value is the value used for RXDRGNAM. 

In 1996-2013 samples, in the case that a prescription drug name was determined to be a confidentiality risk, RXDRGNAM is assigned a value of 8 – “Unknown-not ascertained.”

Additionally, diabetic equipment and supplies (see RXNAME) are also assigned a RXDRGNAM value of 8 – “Unknown-not ascertained” for all years.]]></codInstr>

Users are encouraged to validate universes for their analyses. Additionally, users should proceed with caution when using the Multum Lexicon therapeutic class variables because the classification scheme has changed over time with the addition of new classes and sub-classes and changes to the hierarchy of classes. See the comparability tab for more details. 

Multum Lexicon Variables

Cerner Multum, Inc. develops the Multum Lexicon database that MEPS uses to classify drugs reported by respondents in the MEPS-HC into the therapeutic class, sub-class, and sub-sub-class variables. In this classification system, each drug is assigned to a maximum of three therapeutic classes, such as cardiovascular agents or psychotherapeutic agents. Within each therapeutic class, drugs can also be assigned to one or more sub-classes, such as diuretics or antidepressants. Within each sub-class, drugs can also be assigned to one or more sub-sub-classes, such as loop diuretics or SSRI antidepressants. IPUMS MEPS currently offers the first therapeutic class a drug was assigned to as well as the corresponding sub-classes and sub-sub-classes. These variables include: 

Multum Lexicon therapeutic class variables
MULTC1: Multum Lexicon therapeutic class 1

MULTC1S1: Multum Lexicon therapeutic class 1, sub-class 1

MULTC1S1S1: Multum Lexicon therapeutic class 1, sub-class 1, sub-sub-class 1

MULTC1S1S2: Multum Lexicon therapeutic class 1, sub-class 1, sub-sub-class 2

MULTC1S2: Multum Lexicon therapeutic class 1, sub-class 2

MULTC1S2S1: Multum Lexicon therapeutic class 1, sub-class 2, sub-sub-class 1

MULTC1S3: Multum Lexicon therapeutic class 1, sub-class 3

MULTC1S3S1: Multum Lexicon therapeutic class 1, sub-class 3, sub-sub-class 1
IPUMS MEPS plans to release additional Multum Lexicon therapeutic class variables in the future.

Take note: IPUMS MEPS offers corrected Multum Lexicon data

Users should note that in 2017, AHRQ released Multum Lexicon Addendum files for 1996-2013 after discovering incorrect linkages between the MEPS Prescribed Medicines files and the Cerner Multum file, resulting in some incorrect therapeutic classes being assigned. The errors involved some diagnostic tests and medical devices that were accidentally assigned to a therapeutic class and should not have been. These errors included the following: 

Some diabetic supplies erroneously assigned to a sex hormone sub-class in 1996-2002 and then erroneously assigned to a toxoids sub-class in 2003-2010.

The national drug code (NDC) 00169750111 was being misassigned. It should have been assigned to MULTC1=358 and MULTC1S1=99.
The released addendum files contained corrected versions of the therapeutic class and sub-class variables and PREGCAT. They also contained RXDRGNAM, which was not previously released for 1996-2012. The 2013 Multum Lexicon Addendum file also contained corrected values of RXDRGNAM for some records.

IPUMS MEPS provides the corrected versions of the Multum Lexicon therapeutic class and sub-class variables as well as PREGCAT and RXDRGNAM for all years. 

Users using the Multum Lexicon variables should cite Multum Lexicon, AHRQ, and IPUMS MEPS as the data sources.]]></txt>
